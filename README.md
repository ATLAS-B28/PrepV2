# Roadmap-DSA - 
All the core concepts regarding Data Structures and algorithms and Interview Questions are actively added from various sources in Java and Go language.
## Why Java?
Java is a write-once-run-anywhere language, it is a statically typed compiled language used in all the major systems and applications.
Many companies all across the industry therefore require Java and that's why the DSA concepts in Java are very crucial.

Data Structure -
1. Most of the data structures implemented

Updates for the Algorithms- 
1. Backtracking
2. Greedy Algorithms
3. More Graph Algorithms
4. String and sub-string search algorithms
5. More cache
## Why GO?
GO language started out as an internal language at GOOGLE for their server code and now is rapidly gaining ground in the industry. GO has very simple syntax but 
has a very C/C++-like execution speed and can do concurrency and garbage collection. Therefore, learning DSA concepts in GO is very helpful.

## Note- 
More languages like Javascript, Kotlin, and Python will be added very soon.

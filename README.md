# Roadmap-DSA - 
All the core concepts regarding Data Structures and algorithms and Interview Questions are actively added from various sources in Java, C, C++ and Go language.
## Why Java?
Java is a write-once-run-anywhere language, it is a statically typed compiled language used in all the major systems and applications.
Many companies all across the industry therefore require Java and that's why the DSA concepts in Java are very crucial.
For basics of Java - https://github.com/ATLAS-B28/java-tut.
For CtCI library and questions refer to original - https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition/tree/master.
It is used to learn and practice the questions of in the book - CtCI.
Also, it has the CtCI library which is not mine.

Currently, Doing -
1. CtCI and LeetCode questions underway.
2. DP will be implemented soon

Note: All other languages and their DSA are holted
 

## Why Go?
GO language started out as an internal language at GOOGLE for their server code and now is rapidly gaining ground in the industry. GO has very simple syntax but 
has a very C/C++-like execution speed and can do concurrency and garbage collection. Therefore, learning DSA concepts in GO is very helpful.

## Why C/C++ ?
C/C++ languages are used since a long time and will teach us to manage memory and concurrency.
